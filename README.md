# Activity Art

## Summary
This Android application uses the Strava API to enable athletes to generate aesthetic, highly-modular visualizations of their workouts fit for digital printing. An athlete might only want to use some of their activities, so they may use various filters including date, type, and distance. The artwork may be styled by changing the background, activities, or text colors to the athletes' desire and with customizable typography, including a diverse selection of fonts. The generated art may be set to whichever aspect ratio and resolution the athletes require for the particular print size needed.

An athlete may download or share the artwork after they are finished customizing it.
