# Strava Activity Art
**Latest Release** <br>
*Alpha 0.2.0*

This Android application leverages the Strava API to generate aesthetic, highly-modular visualizations of athelete's workouts fit for digital printing. The user may choose which years, months, activity types, distances, and gears to visualize from and, in future versions, will customize the conditional formatting styling of the activities on those same parameters. Some Android technologies utilized include Jetpack Compose, Room, Retrofit, Accompanist, and Dagger Hilt.
